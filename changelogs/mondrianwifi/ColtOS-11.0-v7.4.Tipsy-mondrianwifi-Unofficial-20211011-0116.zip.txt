(Please report bugs on Clean Flash only!!!)
-Minor Bugs:
-To enable Miracast, go to wireless display 
(longpress the ScreenCast QS icon, click the menu icon (top right) and enable wireless display)
you will have to connect/disconnect from this screen too, miracast disp. will not show up in the QS icon or quick popup.

-MHL support is minimal and very buggy.
-Some UI settings don't play well (colt decorations) and can cause System UI crashes, looking into possible solutions.

-Undetected bugs.
You tell me, I can only test so much on my tablet.
